The Venk Algorithm:

In a complete graph, if edge distances between neighboring nodes are unknown,
but every node's total distance to a specific node is known, where total distance is the
sum of edge lengths in the shortest path from a node to said specific node, let the 
specific node be 'end node'. 

Then, the shortest path between any node in the graph and the end node, is formed by 
traversing from the current node to the neighbouring node with the shortest total distance
to the end node, until the end node is reached.
